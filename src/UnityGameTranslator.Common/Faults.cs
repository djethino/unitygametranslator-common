    /// outside its control) and by this library.

    /// 🔴 **Never a reason to catch.** Most failures have a condition that recognises them before
    /// they happen (a member that is absent, a file that is not there, an address that does not
    /// parse): that condition is the answer, not a catch. What reaches here is what no condition
    /// can foresee, at a place where letting it escape would do more harm than the failure itself.
    ///
    /// 🔴 **And never silent.** A `catch { }` makes a program blind: 375 of them were found in the
    /// mod on 2026-09-27, one of which swallowed every error the router raised while putting a late
    /// translation back on screen; 234 in the Manager on 2026-10-07, one of which announced a backup
    /// that had not been written, just before deleting what it was meant to protect.

    /// before that are kept and handed over, so a failure during start-up is not lost.
